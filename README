DESCRIPTION

    of the OpenVPN server.

    It parses OpenVPN status log and displays active sessions. Supported all
    three versions of the status log. Check the OpenVPN server documentation
    how to set up version. Howewer, there is no needs (and no ability, at
    the moment) to point version of status log. Application detect it
    authomatically. Also status log version will be diplayed on the
    generated web page.

    *Twitter Bootstrap* layout is used to diplay active OpenVPN sessions.

    status_from
        Path to OpenVPN server status log file. This option is required. At
        the moment, the application can able to read versions 1, 2, 3 of the
        status log file.

    custom_view

        Text::MicroTemplate's template. The hashref of params is passed to
        the view as first argument. So you can use it like this:

            % my $vars = $_[0];

        Now $vars contains the structure like this:

            $vars = {
                'updated' => 'Wed Dec  5 21:25:58 2012',
                'version' => '2',
                'users'   => [
                    {
                        'common-name' => 'cadvecisvo',
                        'remote-ip'   => '1.2.3.4',
                        'remote-port' => '4944',
                        'rx-bytes'    => '1.21 Mio',
                        'tx-bytes'    => '503.1 Kio',
                        'connected'   => 'Wed Dec  5 21:16:58 2012',
                        'virtual'     => '00:ff:de:ad:be:ef',
                        'last-ref'    => 'Wed Dec  5 21:25:55 2012',
